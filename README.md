# Solidity Project
This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language in the context of a token economy. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works in a real-world scenario.

# Description
This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language in the context of a token economy. The contract defines a Token struct that contains a name, symbol, and totalSupply variable, as well as a balanceOf mapping that tracks the balance of each address. The contract also includes a transfer function that allows users to transfer tokens to other addresses. This program serves as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works in a real-world scenario. By deploying this contract on the Ethereum blockchain, users can create and transfer tokens, demonstrating the basic functionality of Solidity and smart contracts in a token economy

# Getting Started 

## Executing Project
* To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at  https://remix.ethereum.org/.
  
* Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., SolidityProject.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:
